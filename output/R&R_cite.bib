	abstract = {Fitness apps, such as Strava, are a growing source of data for mapping bicycling ridership, due to large samples and high resolution. To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling ({AADB}) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, {LASSO}, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the {LASSO}-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.},

This ecological study examined associations between income quintiles and availability of cycling infrastructure and cycling behaviour in 1282 census tracts in 8 cities in Canada. The outcomes were Bike Score, its components (Bike Lane Score, Hill Score, and Destinations and Connectivity Score), and bicycle to work mode share. Quintiles of median income were calculated from the 2011 National Household Survey Data. We used linear and negative binomial regression with city level fixed effects, and controlled for unemployment, home ownership, total population, and number of new immigrants in the last 5 years in the census tract to examine social inequalities in environmental supports for cycling and bicycling behaviour. The mean Bike Score and bicycle to work mode share across all census tracts were 72.4 ({SD} = 16.9) and 2.6 ({SD} = 4.0), respectively. Final regression models showed significant income quintile gradients for Bike Score and Bike Lane Score. For bicycle to work mode share, higher income areas had significantly greater cycling compared to the lowest income areas, although there was not a consistent trend across quintiles. Our results show some income inequalities are present in the availability and quality of cycling infrastructure in several Canadian cities.},

	abstract = {Background
Cycling advocates have recently argued that low-income and minority communities across the U.S. have disproportionately low access to bike lanes. To date, however, quantitative evidence of disparities in access to bike lanes is limited to a small number of cities.
Methods
We address this research gap by examining cross-sectional associations between bike lanes and sociodemographic characteristics at the block group level for 23 large U.S. cities (n=22,164 block groups). Dependent variables include the presence (yes/no), density, connectivity, and proximity of bike lanes, measured using secondary {GIS} data collected by each of the 23 cities between 2012 and 2016. Primary independent variables include indicators of race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, poverty, and a composite socioeconomic status ({SES}) index, measured using data from the 2011–2015 American Community Survey. We use linear and logistic multilevel mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between these sociodemographic characteristics and each bike lane dependent variable, before and after adjusting for traditional indicators of cycling demand (population and employment density, distance to downtown, percent of population between ages 18 and 34, percent of workers commuting by bicycle).
Results
In unadjusted associations, disadvantaged block groups (i.e. lower {SES}, higher proportions of minority residents) had significantly lower access to bike lanes. After adjusting for traditional indicators of cycling demand, access to bike lanes remained lower for block groups with particular types of disadvantage (lower educational attainment, higher proportions of Hispanic residents, lower composite {SES}) but not with other types of disadvantage (lower proportions of black residents, lower income, higher poverty).
Conclusions
These results provide empirical support for advocates’ claims of distributional inequalities in bike lane access, suggesting the importance of more closely considering social equity in the bicycle planning and advocacy process.},

	abstract = {Motor vehicles are the main source of many hazardous air pollutants in California. Previous studies have shown that low-income and minority populations are more likely to live near industrial sources of pollution and in areas that do not meet national air quality standards. We estimated neighborhood exposures to motor vehicle emissions from a road network with daily traffic counts using a geographic information system. To calculate traffic density, we summed the average daily vehicle miles of travel per square mile of land area for each census block group in the state. We used 1990 census data to characterize the population by age, race and socioeconomic status in block groups with high traffic density. Block groups with more than 500,000 vehicle miles of travel per square mile were defined to be high traffic density. Statewide, about 5\% of all block groups met this criterion and more than 215,000 children under 15 years of age lived in these high traffic density areas. Block groups in the lowest quartile of median family income were three times more likely to have high traffic density than block groups in the highest income quartile. The percentage of children living in high traffic density block groups increased with decreasing median family income for all race and ethnicities except White. Overall, children of color were about three times more likely to live in high-traffic areas than were white children. Based on this analysis, low-income and children of color have higher potential exposure to vehicle emissions. Future exposure assessment studies should target the highest traffic density areas, and health studies should consider the differences by income and race or ethnicity during design.},

This paper aimed to (i) differentiate the effects of contributory factors on crash risks related to different transportation modes, i.e., motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian; (ii) explore the potential contribution of zone-level factors which are traditionally excluded or omitted, so as to track the source of heterogeneous effects of certain risk factors in crash-frequency models by different modes.
Methods
Two analytical methods, i.e. negative binomial models ({NB}) and random parameters negative binomial models ({RPNB}), were employed to relate crash frequencies of different transportation modes to a variety of risk factors at intersections. Five years of crash data, traffic volume, geometric design as well as macroscopic variables at traffic analysis zone ({TAZ}) level for 279 intersections were used for analysis as a case study.
Results
Among the findings are: (1) the sets of significant variables in crash-frequency analysis differed for different transportation modes; (2) omission of macroscopic variables would result in biased parameters estimation and incorrect inferences; (3) the zonal factors (macroscopic factors) considered played a more important role in elevating the model performance for non-motorized than motor-vehicle crashes; (4) a relatively smaller buffer width to extract macroscopic factors surrounding the intersection yielded better estimations.},

	abstract = {Transportation agencies need efficient methods to determine how to reduce bicycle accidents while promoting cycling activities and prioritizing safety improvement investments. Many studies have used standalone methods, such as level of traffic stress ({LTS}) and bicycle level of service ({BLOS}), to better understand bicycle mode share and network connectivity for a region. However, in most cases, other studies rely on crash severity models to explain what variables contribute to the severity of bicycle related crashes. This research uniquely correlates bicycle {LTS} with reported bicycle crash locations for four cities in New Hampshire through geospatial mapping. {LTS} measurements and crash locations are compared visually using a {GIS} framework. Next, a bicycle injury severity model, that incorporates {LTS} measurements, is created through a mixed logit modeling framework. Results of the visual analysis show some geospatial correlation between higher {LTS} roads and “Injury” type bicycle crashes. It was determined, statistically, that {LTS} has an effect on the severity level of bicycle crashes and high {LTS} can have varying effects on severity outcome. However, it is recommended that further analyses be conducted to better understand the statistical significance and effect of {LTS} on injury severity. As such, this research will validate the use of {LTS} as a proxy for safety risk regardless of the recorded bicycle crash history. This research will help identify the clustering patterns of bicycle crashes on high-risk corridors and, therefore, assist with bicycle route planning and policy making. This paper also suggests low-cost countermeasures or treatments that can be implemented to address high-risk areas. Specifically, with the goal of providing safer routes for cyclists, such countermeasures or treatments have the potential to substantially reduce the number of fatalities and severe injuries.},

In this study, we exploit a large dataset of {GPS} trajectories of bicycle trips in combination with a fine-grained representation of the Copenhagen bicycle-relevant network. We apply a model for bicyclists’ choice of route from origin to destination that takes the complete network into account. This enables us to determine bicyclists’ preferences for a range of infrastructure and land-use types. We use the estimated preferences to compute a generalized cost of bicycle travel, which we correlate with the number of bicycle trips across a large number of origin–destination pairs. Simulations suggest that the extensive Copenhagen bicycle lane network has caused the number of bicycle trips and the bicycle kilometers traveled to increase by 60\% and 90\%, respectively, compared with a counterfactual without the bicycle lane network. This translates into an annual benefit of €0.4M per km of bicycle lane owing to changes in generalized travel cost, health, and accidents. Our results thus strongly support the provision of bicycle infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, metropolitan areas are prioritizing growth in the share of trips taken by bicycle to improve health outcomes, transportation affordability, and environmental performance of the transport system. Evidence is building that network quality is an important determinant in bicycle commuting and route choice. One prominent metric of facility attractiveness is bicycle level of traffic stress ({LTS}). In tandem, {OpenStreetMap} ({OSM}) is becoming an important source of network data for routing and for generating measures of multimodal accessibility. Although there are studies that examine the completeness of {OSM} tags and utilize {OSM} data to compute {LTS} on networks, none of them examine the accuracy of these analyses. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of {OSM}-derived {LTS} predictions and offer quality assurance strategies to reduce inaccurate predictions. This study compares {OSM}-derived {LTS} predictions with ground-truthed {LTS} scores created by Montgomery County. It finds that {OSM}-derived {LTS} networks provide comparable results to the ground-truthed data. The {OSM}-derived {LTS} scores correctly identified 89.9\% of the length of the network as either high ({LTS} 3 or 4) or low stress ({LTS} 1 or 2). However, this study demonstrates there is a higher potential for error within certain street typologies and urban contexts, and that low-stress accessibility calculations can be very sensitive to even a small number of incorrectly classified segments. Finally, practices to improve the quality of {OSM}-derived {LTS} predictions and low-stress accessibility calculations are suggested.},

We conducted a retrospective analysis of travel surveys, bicycle infrastructure and population and land use characteristics in the Greater Melbourne region, Australia.

We highlight areas with high bicycle network density and a high proportion of trips made by bike (Cluster 1; reflecting 12\% of the population of Greater Melbourne, but 57\% of all bike trips) and areas with high off-road and on-road bicycle network length, but a low proportion of trips made by bike (Cluster 4, reflecting 23\% of the population of Greater Melbourne and 13\% of all bike trips). Our novel approach to developing an urban biking typology enabled the exploration of the interaction of bicycle ridership, the bicycle network, population and land use characteristics. Such approaches are important in advancing our understanding of bicycling behaviour, but further research is required to understand the generalisability of these findings to other settings.},

Street networks that are more grid-like are preferred over networks that include many cul-de-sacs and long blocks, thus increasing distances between destinations. The increased distances are thought to discourage walking and bicycling and, thus, physical activity. While intuitively attractive, there is limited empirical research at this time making this connection. There is also debate over how to measure connectivity and what levels of connectivity are appropriate. The objective of this research is to evaluate various measures of connectivity for the purpose of increasing walking and bicycling. Measures of connectivity can be useful in two arenas: (1) research linking travel behavior (and perhaps physical activity and health) to urban form; and (2) public policy establishing performance standards for new and/or existing development. This paper first defines and describes a wide range of measures of connectivity, drawn from multiple fields, including transportation, urban planning, geography, and landscape ecology.

	shorttitle = {Are Dominant Routes the Least Stressful Routes in a Bike Share System?},
	abstract = {Level of Traffic Stress ({LTS}) is a four-level system that classifies the stress experienced by cyclists on road segments and at intersections. While {LTS} has been used in past studies to assess cycling connectivity, accessibility, and safety, very little is known concerning its influence on cycling preferences. This study investigates this topic using a dataset containing 323,163 unique {GPS} trajectories of Hamilton Bike Share ({HBS}) users collected over a 12-month period (January 1st to December 31st, 2019). A {GIS}-based map-matching algorithm is used to generate users’ routes from these trajectories along with attributes such as route length, number of intersections, and number of turns. Unique routes and their use frequencies are then extracted from all routes. The most popular routes between bike share hub (station) pairs are then identified as dominant routes while shortest distance routes are derived by minimizing distance traveled. Weighted level of traffic stress ({WLTS}), a novel measure of impedance (travel cost) developed for this study, is used to derive the least stressful routes between hub pairs. The three types of routes are compared statistically. The comparison finds that {HBS} users tend to choose longer routes with bicycle infrastructure in an effort to reduce their traffic stress. However, they do not choose to minimize traffic stress in its entirety by choosing the lowest {WLTS} routes. In other words, dominant routes are not the least stressful routes in a bike share system. Likewise, minimizing distance is not the sole consideration of {HBS} users. The findings suggest that other factors also influence route choice. This study not only enhances our understanding of cyclist route preferences with respect to {LTS}, it also presents a novel measure of impedance – {WLTS} – that could be used when planning new cycling infrastructure or as an alternative means to route cyclists between origins and destinations.},
