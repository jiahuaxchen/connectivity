	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of spatial correlation using a Bayesian spatial framework to model pedestrian and bicycle crashes in Traffic Analysis Zones ({TAZs}). Aggregate models for pedestrian and bicycle crashes were estimated as a function of variables related to roadway characteristics, and various demographic and socio-economic factors. It was found that significant differences were present between the predictor sets for pedestrian and bicycle crashes. The Bayesian Poisson-lognormal model accounting for spatial correlation for pedestrian crashes in the {TAZs} of the study counties retained nine variables significantly different from zero at 95\% Bayesian credible interval. These variables were – total roadway length with 35mph posted speed limit, total number of intersections per {TAZ}, median household income, total number of dwelling units, log of population per square mile of a {TAZ}, percentage of households with non-retired workers but zero auto, percentage of households with non-retired workers and one auto, long term parking cost, and log of total number of employment in a {TAZ}. A separate distinct set of predictors were found for the bicycle crash model. In all cases the Bayesian models with spatial correlation performed better than the models that did not account for spatial correlation among {TAZs}. This finding implies that spatial correlation should be considered while modeling pedestrian and bicycle crashes at the aggregate or macro-level.},

	abstract = {Many cities worldwide are recognizing the important role that cycling plays in creating green and livable communities. However, vulnerable road users such as cyclists are usually subjected to an elevated level of injury risk which discourages many road users to cycle. This paper studies cyclist-vehicle collisions at 134 traffic analysis zones in the city of Vancouver to assess the impact of bike network structure on cyclist safety. Several network indicators were developed using Graph theory and their effect on cyclist safety was investigated. The indicators included measures of connectivity, directness, and topography of the bike network. The study developed several macro-level (zonal) collision prediction models that explicitly incorporated bike network indicators as explanatory variables. As well, the models incorporated the actual cyclist exposure (bike kilometers travelled) as opposed to relying on proxies such as population or bike network length. The macro-level collision prediction models were developed using generalized linear regression and full Bayesian techniques, with and without spatial effects. The models showed that cyclist collisions were positively associated with bike and vehicle exposure. The exponents of the exposure variables were less than one which supports the “safety in numbers” hypothesis. Moreover, the models showed positive associations between cyclist collisions and the bike network connectivity and linearity indicators. In contrast, negative associations were found between cyclist collisions and the bike network continuity and topography indicators. The spatial effects were statistically significant in all of the developed models.},

	abstract = {Cities are promoting bicycling for transportation as an antidote to increased traffic congestion, obesity and related health issues, and air pollution. However, both research and practice have been stalled by lack of data on bicycling volumes, safety, infrastructure, and public attitudes. New technologies such as {GPS}-enabled smartphones, crowdsourcing tools, and social media are changing the potential sources for bicycling data. However, many of the developments are coming from data science and it can be difficult evaluate the strengths and limitations of crowdsourced data. In this narrative review we provide an overview and critique of crowdsourced data that are being used to fill gaps and advance bicycling behaviour and safety knowledge. We assess crowdsourced data used to map ridership (fitness, bike share, and {GPS}/accelerometer data), assess safety (web-map tools), map infrastructure ({OpenStreetMap}), and track attitudes (social media). For each category of data, we discuss the challenges and opportunities they offer for researchers and practitioners. Fitness app data can be used to model spatial variation in bicycling ridership volumes, and {GPS}/accelerometer data offer new potential to characterise route choice and origin-destination of bicycling trips; however, working with these data requires a high level of training in data science. New sources of safety and near miss data can be used to address underreporting and increase predictive capacity but require grassroots promotion and are often best used when combined with official reports. Crowdsourced bicycling infrastructure data can be timely and facilitate comparisons across multiple cities; however, such data must be assessed for consistency in route type labels. Using social media, it is possible to track reactions to bicycle policy and infrastructure changes, yet linking attitudes expressed on social media platforms with broader populations is a challenge. New data present opportunities for improving our understanding of bicycling and supporting decision making towards transportation options that are healthy and safe for all. However, there are challenges, such as who has data access and how data crowdsourced tools are funded, protection of individual privacy, representativeness of data and impact of biased data on equity in decision making, and stakeholder capacity to use data given the requirement for advanced data science skills. If cities are to benefit from these new data, methodological developments and tools and training for end-users will need to track with the momentum of crowdsourced data.},

	abstract = {Many cities in the United States are working to become more “bike-friendly” through the provision of new bike infrastructure that is safe and attractive for all types of cyclists, from the timid to assured. These efforts are supported by evidence associating low level of traffic stress facilities with increased cycling activity rates and co-benefits related to the economy, environment, and public health. However, not every mile of bike infrastructure provides the same utility, prompting planning agencies with finite financial resources to search for empirical methods to help evaluate what projects will provide the greatest network connectivity benefit and how disparate projects can complement one another to produce a complete bike network. In this study, we introduce the Cyclist Routing Algorithm for Network Connectivity ({CRANC}), an accessibility-oriented decision-support tool designed to quantify the benefits of new bike facilities for various populations and neighborhoods. Unlike prior tools, this method simulates the route preferences of different cyclist types and trade-offs in travel time and level of traffic stress to model potential changes in destination accessibility that may result from multiple scenarios of citywide and regional bike network expansion. Here, {CRANC} is applied to the Boston region’s bike network to determine how a proposed shared-use path in Cambridge, Massachusetts will improve accessibility to regional job opportunities and to labor force for employment sites in Cambridge. Our introduced decision-support tool produces unique, meaningful results relevant to a variety of stakeholders, and holds promise as a new resource for transportation researchers and practitioners.},

The method was programmed as a geographic information system tool and requires commonly available data. The tool is demonstrated on three improvement scenarios that were recently proposed for Seattle, Washington. The full build-out scenario consists of 771 projects that include various new bike lanes, protected bike lanes, and multi-use trails. The tool produces priority rankings based on a project’s ability to improve low-stress connectivity between homes and important destinations. The analysis identifies specific areas and neighborhoods that can be expected to exhibit better bikeability.

Data from the city of Vancouver, Canada, are used as a case study. Full Bayesian modeling incorporating spatial effects is employed to develop Bike Kilometers Travelled ({BKT}) and bike–vehicle crash models.

On the other hand, the bike network complexity and development, connectivity, and linearity have positive associations with bike–vehicle crashes. The models provide insights that can be useful for planning bike networks to increase bike traffic and improve bike safety. The models also show that some changes to a bike network to increase bike traffic should be accompanied by crash risk-mitigating measures.

	abstract = {Introduction
The health benefits of cycling have widely been recognized, but cycling is also associated with health risks (e.g., pollution exposure, crash risk). Past studies of these competing health impacts have been limited in their treatment of social equity, rarely considering spatial variations in risk that could be highly salient for marginalized populations. This study investigates the health risks of cycling through the lens of social equity by considering variations in {PM}2.5 concentrations and crash risk across space and across sociodemographic groups.
Methods
We conducted this analysis in Los Angeles County, {CA}, which has a relatively high bicycle fatality rate and consistent non-attainment status for traffic-related {PM}2.5. We used publicly available data, including {PM}2.5 concentrations, crash locations, bicycle counts, and street network data, to derive measures of pollution exposure and crash risk. We performed descriptive, visualization, and regression analyses to assess how pollution exposure and crash risk vary across census block groups and are associated with area-level sociodemographic characteristics.
Results
We found that the health risks of cycling are disproportionately high among marginalized populations (i.e. in block groups with lower income, lower educational attainment, and higher shares of racial/ethnic minority populations). Census block groups with worse outdoor air quality and higher crash risk are particularly likely to be home to low-income people of color. Even in these places, the health benefits of cycling could outweigh the risks; however, the net health benefits of cycling, accounting for these risks, are likely to be lower in marginalized communities.
Conclusions
Health impact assessments related to cycling should incorporate neighborhood-level data to better assess the distribution of benefits and risks across space and across population groups. Efforts to promote cycling should focus on making cycling safer and healthier, placing emphasis on communities where it is associated with the greatest health risks.},

Under three percent of crashes involve non-motorists statewide, but these account for about one third of all traffic fatalities in the state. Methods: Our analysis is broken down into five parts: we (1) analyze the relationship between minority and low-income communities and non-motorist involved crashes; (2) identify spatial differences between non-motorist involved crashes and non-motorist involved fatal crashes; (3) compare the factors affecting fatal pedestrian crashes in New Jersey and in four counties in southern New Jersey for which we have data on pedestrian infrastructure; (4) compare the factors affecting fatal pedestrian crashes and fatal cyclist crashes in New Jersey; and, (5) discuss priority areas for improving safety. Results: Crashes occur disproportionately more often in low-income communities. Moreover, we find that crashes are less likely to be geocoded if they take place in low-income and minority areas, a concerning finding considering that geocoded crashes are of paramount importance in identifying specific corridors for improvement. Light conditions, non-motorist age, posted speed, and vehicle type are significant factors influencing the fatality of non-motorist involved crashes. The proximity to a crosswalk or sidewalk is associated with decreased risk of a fatal crash for pedestrians. Cyclist crashes in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to be fatal – a finding that we attribute to lower access to bicycle facilities in low-income areas. Conclusions: We conclude with countermeasures, including a call for better data collection.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Traffic fatalities remain a major public health challenge despite progress made during recent decades. This study develops exposure-based estimates of fatalities per mile traveled for pedestrians, cyclists, and light-duty vehicle occupants and describes disparities by race/ethnicity, including a subanalysis of fatality rates during darkness and in urban areas.
{METHODS}: Estimates of person-miles traveled by mode and race/ethnicity group were derived from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey using replicate weights. Three-year average (2016‒2018) traffic fatalities were measured by mode and race/ethnicity group with the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Fatality rates per mile traveled and {CIs} were calculated for each subgroup as well as separately for trips occurring during darkness and in urban areas. Analysis was conducted in 2021‒2022.
{RESULTS}: Exposure to traffic fatality differs by race/ethnicity group and by mode, indicating that adjustment for differential exposure is needed when estimating disparities. The authors find that fatality rates per 100 million miles traveled are systematically higher for Black and Hispanic Americans for all modes and notably higher for vulnerable modes (e.g., Black Americans died at more than 4 times the rate for White Americans while cycling, 33.71 [95\% {CI}: 21.84, 73.83] compared with 7.53 [95\% {CI}: 6.64, 8.69], and more than 2 times the rate while walking, 40.92 [95\% {CI}: 36.58, 46.44] compared with 18.77 [95\% {CI}: 17.30, 20.51]). Previous estimates that do not adjust for differential exposure may underestimate disparities by race/ethnicity. Observed disparities remained when considering only urban areas and appear to be exacerbated during darkness.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Traffic fatalities are a substantial and preventable public health challenge in America. Black and Hispanic Americans have higher traffic fatality rates per mile traveled than White Americans across the transportation system, requiring urgent attention.},

Focusing on Seoul, South Korea, this study examines whether differences in bicycle crash rates between neighborhoods with low and high socioeconomic status ({SES}) exist, and if so, which and to what extent the observable neighborhood characteristics explain them. This study adopts the Gelbach decomposition method to illuminate the sources of bicycle crash disparities between neighborhoods with different {SES}. Results indicate that bicycle crashes are more likely to occur in low-{SES} neighborhoods, regardless of injury severity. However, contrary to popular expectations, the differences in bicycle infrastructure or bicycle traffic volume between high- and low-{SES} neighborhoods do not significantly contribute to the gaps in bicycle crash outcomes between neighborhood types. Instead, the differences in population density and road networks based on neighborhood {SES} are the primary drivers of these gaps. Another notable finding is that the neighborhood-level factors included in the analysis can altogether explain less than 50\% of the disparities in bicycle crashes between neighborhood types. The findings of this study provide valuable policy suggestions that help address spatial equity related to bicycle crashes.},

	abstract = {Despite evidence showing the spatial nonstationarity of the determinants of bike activity, very few studies have addressed the phenomena, probably due to the limited sample size of the traditional count data. To address this gap, this study demonstrated the applicability of Strava bike activity data by developing a geographically weighted Poisson regression ({GWPR}) model that can reveal how the influence of socioeconomic and land-use factors vary across a region. The city of Austin was selected as a case study, and Strava bike volume was gleaned from 1494 intersections. The representativeness of the Strava data was first examined by comparing those data with the video-based actual bicycle volume data from 43 intersections in the study area. Despite the high deviation in several locations, Strava volume exhibited moderate linear relationships with actual volume. The {GWPR} model developed in this study outperformed the traditional global model and revealed significant spatial variability of nine variables related to age, income, education, transit stops, hub locations, offices, schools, trails, and sidewalk facilities. Notable spatial variations on bike activity were observed across the study area in terms of magnitude, direction, and significance of the impact for all model variables. The analysis and discussion offer guidance to practitioners and policy makers in tailoring policies and programs that consider the spatial context. The study also provides insights for understanding the potential use of crowdsourced data in examining bike activity, especially when resources are limited.},

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is to examine the influence of network, land use, and demographic characteristics on the number of bicycle-vehicle crashes, and to develop area-level bicycle-vehicle crash estimation models (safety performance functions) for urban roads. Mecklenburg County in the State of North Carolina was considered as the study area. The reported bicycle-vehicle crash data, from 2010 to 2015, along with the network, land use, and demographic characteristics data were obtained from the local agencies. Data within a one-mile buffer of 119 selected locations was then captured. Data for 99 selected locations were used for the modeling purpose, while data for the remaining 20 selected locations were used for validating the models. Six alternate models were developed, considering various combinations of explanatory variables that are not correlated with each other. As the bicycle-vehicle crash dataset used in this research was observed to be over-dispersed (variance greater than the mean), Negative Binomial log-link distribution-based models were developed. The validation dataset was used to compare the estimated number of bicycle-vehicle crashes from each model with the actual number of bicycle-vehicle crashes. The results obtained from the analysis and modeling suggest that bicyclists are more often involved in crashes while traveling on segments with no bicycle lane, the traffic light, 45 mph as the speed limit, and in commercial activity, research activity, institutional, multi-family residential (densely populated), and heavy industrial areas. The computed Moran's Index values indicate weak to no spatial correlation between the residuals of each model. However, the residuals seem to depend on the area type and the number of bicycle-vehicle crashes.},

	abstract = {In order to improve traffic safety, a large amount of works focusing on crash prediction and identifying factors contributing to crashes. However, the ignorance of data unobserved heterogeneity in some traditional models may lead to biased parameter estimation and erroneous inferences. To investigate the relationship between crash and the potential contributing factors, the crash data occurred in 3-year survey period on Interstate highways in Washington, including 134 fatal crashes, 13936 injury crashes, and 34,084 property damage only ({PDO}) crashes were collected. A data quality control method based on sensitivity analysis is used to determine the road segments. Then a negative binomial ({NB}) model and a random negative binomial ({RENB}) model are constructed to predict crash number. The inverse stepwise procedure was applied to examine the significance of explanatory variable. The horizontal alignment type, speed limit, visibility, road surface condition, and {AADT} are identified as significant factors on the crash. In the comparison, four standard errors are designed as indicators, and the results show that the errors of {RENB} model are lower than that of {NB} model. The comparing results illustrate that the {RENB} model outperforms the {NB} model in crash number prediction and safety service level prediction},

The study used four years (2011–2014) of crash data from Florida to quantify the safety impacts of roadway and traffic characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, and bicycle activity data on bicycle crashes. A cross-sectional analysis using Generalized Linear Model ({GLM}) approach with Zero Inflated Negative Binomial ({ZINB}) distribution was adopted to develop the relevant regression models in this study. Lane width, speed limit, and grass in the median were observed to have positive impacts on reducing bicycle crashes. On the contrary, presence of sidewalk and sidewalk barrier were found to increase the bicycle crash probabilities. Increased bicycle activity was found to reduce the bicycle crash probabilities on segments, while increased bicycle activity resulted in higher bicycle crash probabilities at intersections. Bus stops were found to increase the bicycle crash probabilities at intersections, whereas, protected signal control had a positive impact on bicycle safety. This research provides a greater insight into how various characteristics affect bicycle safety, a topic that is seldom considered by researchers and practitioners.},

	abstract = {It is widely agreed today that the existence of a network of bicycle paths fosters a feeling of safety as well as the use of the bicycle for both recreational and utilitarian purposes. Recent studies have found a link between the presence of cycling infrastructures and gentrification. Few studies have however examined the growth of the cycling networks from the perspective of environmental equity. The main objective of this study is to determine whether the extension of the cycling network in the urban areas of Montreal and Longueuil and the city of Laval over a quarter of a century (1991 to 2016) has reduced or reinforced inequities in accessibility for low-income populations, recent immigrants, children, and older people. Archival maps were employed to reconstruct the cycling networks in the Montreal area in a {GIS} for six years (1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016). Census data and spatial analysis methods were then used to measure whether or not inequities in the accessibility of the cycling network increased over the period in question. The results show that, in 25 years, the cycling network has more than doubled in size. It can however be seen that some areas are still very poorly served, and that the network lacks connectivity. Low-income individuals have generally enjoyed good accessibility over the entire period. A strong decrease in inaccessibility for recent immigrants and seniors is also observed. The most important result is clearly that there has been little or no improvement for children, who are found to be in a situation of inequity.},

This study assessed the usefulness of a smartphone {GPS} tracking system for evaluating the impact of this strategy on cycling behaviour. Methods Cycling usage data were collected from Queenslanders who used a {GPS} tracking app on their smartphone from 2013-2014. 'Heat' and volume maps of the data were reviewed, and {GPS} bicycle counts were compared with surveillance data and bicycle counts from automatic traffic-monitoring devices. Results Heat maps broadly indicated that changes in cycling occurred near infrastructure improvements. Volume maps provided changes in counts of cyclists due to these improvements although errors were noted in geographic information system ({GIS}) geo-coding of some {GPS} data. Large variations were evident in the number of cyclists using the app in different locations. These variations limited the usefulness of {GPS} data for assessing differences in cycling across locations. Conclusion Smartphone {GPS} data are useful in evaluating the impact of improved bicycle infrastructure in one location. Using {GPS} data to evaluate differential changes in cycling across multiple locations is problematic when there is insufficient traffic-monitoring devices available to triangulate {GPS} data with bicycle traffic count data. So what? The use of smartphone {GPS} data with other data sources is recommended for assessing how infrastructure improvements influence cycling behaviour.},

Strava, a popular fitness tracker, continuously collects human movement trajectories, and its commercial data service, Strava Metro, has enriched bicycle research opportunities over the last five years. Accrued knowledge from colleagues who have already utilised Strava Metro data can be valuable for those seeking expanded monitoring options. To convey such knowledge, this paper synthesises a data overview, extensive literature review on how the data have been applied to deal with drivers’ bicycle-related issues, and implications for future work. The review results indicate that Strava Metro data have the potential—although finite—to be used to identify various travel patterns, estimate travel demand, analyse route choice, control for exposure in crash models, and assess air pollution exposure. However, several challenges, such as the under-representativeness of the general population, bias towards and away from certain groups, and lack of demographic and trip details at the individual level, prevent researchers from depending entirely on the new data source. Cross-use with other sources and validation of reliability with official data could enhance the potentiality.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Despite bicycling being considered ten times more dangerous than driving, the evidence suggests that high-bicycling-mode-share cities are not only safer for bicyclists but for all road users. We look to understand what makes these cities safer. Are the safety differences related to ‘safety-in-numbers’ of bicyclists, or can they be better explained by built environment differences or the people that inhabit them?
Methods
Based on thirteen years of data from twelve large U.S. cities, we investigated over 17,000 fatalities and 77,000 severe injuries across nearly 8700 block groups via multilevel, longitudinal, negative binomial regression models. We hypothesize three pathways towards better road safety outcomes: i) travel behavior differences (e.g. ‘safety-in-numbers’ or shifts to ‘safer’ modes); ii) built environment differences (e.g. infrastructure that helps promote safer environments); and iii) socio-demographic/socio-economic differences (e.g. some cities may be populated by those with lower road safety risk).
Results
The results suggest that more bicyclists is not the reason these cities are safer for all road users. Better safety outcomes are instead associated with a greater prevalence of bike facilities – particularly protected and separated bike facilities – at the block group level and, more strongly so, across the overall city. Higher intersection density, which typically corresponds to more compact and lower-speed built environments, was strongly associated with better road safety outcomes for all road users. The variables representing gentrification also accounted for much of our explainable variation in safety outcomes.
Conclusions
This paper provides an evidence-based approach to building safer cities. While the policy implications of this work point to protected and separated bike infrastructure as part of the solution, we need to keep in mind that these approaches are complementary and should not be considered in isolation. Moreover, our results – particularly the safety disparities associated with gentrification – suggest equity issues and the need for future research.},

With recent growth in cycling and investments in cycling infrastructure, there are concerns that these investments have not been equitable across communities. There is no consistent and complete national dataset for cycling infrastructure in Canada. Our goal is to develop a national cycling infrastructure dataset by (1) classifying {OpenStreetMap} ({OSM}) using the Canadian Bikeway Comfort and Safety Classification System (Can-{BICS}) as consistent criteria and categorisation for comfort class and infrastructure type; (2) performing a site-specific accuracy assessment by comparing the classification with more than 2000 reference points from a stratified random sample in 15 cities; and (3) presenting summary results from the national dataset. Based on reference data collected in 15 test cities, the classification had an estimated accuracy of 76 ± 3\% for presence or absence of infrastructure, 71 ± 4\% for comfort class and 69 ± 4\% (by length) for infrastructure type. High comfort infrastructure was slightly underestimated (since bike paths were sometimes confused with multi-use paths) and low comfort infrastructure was slightly overestimated. Nationally, we identified 22,992 km of cycling infrastructure meeting Can-{BICS} standards and 48,953 km of non-conforming infrastructure. Multi-use paths are the most common infrastructure type by length (16.6\%), followed by painted bike lanes (11.0\%), and then high comfort infrastructure (cycle tracks, local street bikeways and bike paths) (4.3\%). There was a wider range in access to cycling infrastructure in small cities than in medium and large cities. To reduce repeated effort assembling data and increase reproducible active transportation research, we encourage contribution to {OSM}.},

Crowdsourced data on bicycling safety provides new opportunities for the study of bicycling injury and risk. Our goal was to quantify factors that influence the spatial variation in unsafe bicycling across a city, based on self-reports of bicycling incidents. To meet this goal, we leveraged {BikeMaps}.org, a global tool for reporting bicycling safety incidents, drawing on data from Metro Vancouver. We summarized incident conditions that led to injury, developed a model to identify predictors of injury using random forest regression, and mapped bicycling incident hot spots. Our results demonstrate that injuries from bicycling incidents are associated with older and younger bicyclists, downhill slopes, parked cars, recreation and weekend rides, falls, and single bicycle incidents with infrastructure, roads, and railroads. The broad range of incidents reported to {BikeMaps}.org allows us to add evidence that falls and single bicycle collisions are major causes of injury. Also, we demonstrate the value of attributing safety hot spots with contextual details to identify infrastructure interventions that can reduce injury for bicyclists.},

	abstract = {When streets with high traffic stress—on which the mainstream population is unwilling to ride a bike—are removed, the remaining network of streets and paths can be fragmented and poorly connected. This paper describes the development of methods to visualize and to analyze the lack of connectivity in a low-stress bicycling network. A proposed measure to evaluate bicycling networks is the fraction of origin–destination pairs, which are connected without the use of high stress, without excessive detour, and with the origin–destination pairs weighted by travel demand. A new method is proposed to classify segments and crossings into four levels of traffic stress ({LTS}) on the basis of Roger Geller’s classification of the cyclist population and Dutch design standards, which are known to attract the mainstream population. As a case study, every street in San Jose, California, was classified by {LTS} value. Maps that showed only lower stress links revealed a city divided into islands within which low-stress bicycling was possible, but these islands were separated from one another by barriers that could be crossed only with the use of high-stress links. The fraction was 4.7\% of home-to-work trips up to 6 mi long that were connected at a low {LTS} value. The figure would almost triple if a modest slate of improvements were implemented to connect low-stress streets and paths with each other.},

	abstract = {Cycling is promoted as a sustainable and healthy mode of transport, which results in an increase in bicycle use in urban areas. Increasing bicycle use comes with growing concerns about cyclist safety. This study examines how the temporal variation in the network-wide exposure to cyclists and motorised vehicles affects bicycle crash frequency. Network-wide hourly volumes of cyclists and motorised vehicles were estimated and regression models were used to identify the effect of the exposure to traffic on bicycle crashes in the city of Utrecht, a Dutch cycling capital. The results show that increasing exposure to motorised vehicles, and to a lesser extent, exposure to cyclists, increases the number of bicycle crashes on 50 km/h roads. For 30 km/h roads, no statistically significant relationship between the exposure to cyclists and bicycle crashes was found. Moreover, it was shown that cyclist crash numbers on 30 km/h roads are less sensitive to an increase in the exposure to motorised vehicles compared to cyclist crash numbers on 50 km/h roads. Furthermore, the exposure to motorised vehicles is a stronger factor affecting the increase in bicycle crashes on roads with bicycle lanes or mixed traffic conditions than on roads with separated bicycle facilities. To conclude, this study shows that road safety for cyclists needs further improvements, as cycling in cities keeps increasing.},

	abstract = {While the conventional approach to safety planning has emphasized crash analysis with police-reported crash information, transportation professionals increasingly recognize the importance of proactively identifying potential crash risk and considering environmental characteristics. In a proactive approach, individuals' perception of crash risk provides important information in identifying potential crash risk. As built environment characteristics influence the levels of pedestrian and bicycle safety, this study examined how perceived and actual crash risk are related with each other and with respect to built environmental characteristics. Our results showed that residents who live in low density-single residential neighborhoods are more likely to perceive their neighborhood as dangerous relative to residents of compact, mixed-use neighborhoods even though the latter exhibited higher actual crash rates. The results of path analyses confirmed that a simultaneous but opposite relationship exists between perceived and actual crash risks. Our results indicate that higher actual crash risk increases perceived crash risk, while higher perceived crash risk is negatively associated to actual crash rates. Consequently, low density and non-mixed land uses increase individuals perception of crash risk, and increased perception of risk and unfriendly environment for pedestrian and bikers reduces actual crash rates as a result of behavioral changes. From a policy standpoint, more attention and proactive interventions are desirable in suburban areas beyond the areas with high crash rates, as some of these areas have high-perceived risks.},
