## Read in data

1.  Connectivity dataset
2.  Crash 2018- 2022
3.  Strava 2022
4.  ACS 2020: % Total population% Hispanic, % female, % unemployment, median household income
5.  Read in slope shapefile calculated by Colin
6.  Street segment stress

## Calculate variables

1.  Calculate population density: total population/Area (km2)
2.  Calculate weight slope
3.  Aggregate connectivity to BG
4.  Summarize crashes within BG
5.  Summarize strava trips within BG
6.  Summarize high-stress streets within BG

## Prepare recipe

1.  Cbind all data
2.  Correlation matrix
3.  Scale data

## Build regression model

1.  Negative binomial model
2.  Test spatial autocorrelation

## Visualization

1.  summary table of regression model
2.  interaction plot
